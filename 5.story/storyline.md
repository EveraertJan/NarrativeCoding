##world definition##
It is the year 2030. personal robots are very common, and everyone seems to have one. the complication rate of a robot is depending on how much you can pay for it. some received a robot through inheritance, others brand new. 
there are even some people who tried building their own robots, this is percieved as playing god, so most people will try to avoid someone who build his own robot.

nature was destroyed some years ago, and the small woods that are left, have become the main hiding spot for most animals. mothers would tell ghoststories about the wood, and would make sure to end bad, so the child will never enter. This nature is wild, vivid and dangerous.

the governement has started working the same way it did in the middle ages. all big cities have someone to rule it, and this person has no authority outside his heir. some of these local kings are absolutely brutal, others know how it's done
