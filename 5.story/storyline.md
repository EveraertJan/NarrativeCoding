##world definition##
It is the year 2060. personal robots are very common, and everyone seems to have one. the complication rate of a robot is depending on how much you can pay for it. some received a robot through inheritance, others brand new. 
there are even some people who tried building their own robots, this is percieved as playing god, so most people will try to avoid someone who build his own robot. these robots (too bad) are only capable of some basic functionalities, mostly repeating these endless

nature was destroyed some years ago, and the small woods that are left, have become the main hiding spot for most animals. thanks to nature activists, these places were left in their original state. mothers would tell stories about the wood and it's hughe animals, and would make sure to end bad, so the child will never enter. This nature is wild, vivid and dangerous.

the governement has started working the same way it did in the middle ages. all big cities have someone to rule it, and this person has no authority outside his heir. some of these local kings are absolutely brutal, others know how it's done. 

as in our world, society has an upper class, and the ones who have to scrape to come around. some of these also have robots, mostly build from old parts found on the endless scrapyards


##story passing##
the story starts with a sketch of the situation, and placing our main character. he is in the middle class, and made yet it's own robot at home (his dad helped him). because he isn't quite good at programming, the robot isn't capable of much. some rich kids at school used to tease him with it.

although he was born in the center of the city, our main character keeps wondering what the world looks like at the other side of the hughe walls surrounding the city. most of the parents would tell horrorstories, but his granddad tolds stories about animals of wonder, filled with colors and beauty. 

this guy grows up to work at a robotrepaircenter. dispite being good at the hardware, he just can't get his robot to behave however he wants, due to the lack of programmingskills. 

one day, while coding his robot (endless loop) it gets into an error and runs off. our main character riuns after him and ends up outside the walls, gazing at teh world he so desperatly wanted to see when he was young (these wonderings disappeared while growing older and having to study). he looks around, finds the robot (after a while) and wants to go back inside the city.

too bad fior him, the gates have allready closed, while he was looking for his old friend. he remembers his granddad used to tell him he lived right outside town, in a small abandoned village nearby. he decides to go sleep there. walking in the direction he comes across a bridge [code moment one, send robot to look for weak spots in the bridge ] 

he finds shelter in the small village (night has yet fallen) and when he wakes up, he can't remember which way to walk. so he picks a random one, and walks off with his robot, looking for the city and something to eat. he stumbles on a grand forest, which he decides to cross, holding his granddad's stories in the back of his mind. 

some miles into the forest, he comes across a wild robot, a runaway experiment from some years ago. he achieves in reprogramming it into a decent state [code moment two] he continues his path, now with two robots, off into the wild.
